# Lab 16 - AWS: Cloud Servers 

## Deploy a Node.js server to AWS EC2

- The links to both of your deployed servers (GUI deploy and CLI deploy)
- Document your processes

### Deployment
- Im a little confused on how to deploy the CLI, I tried rewatching the lecture and the youtube video we had to watch for the Class 16 reading notes, but Im still lost as to how to deploy on the CLI.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I tried to use Can of books back end and City Explorere - API, and  I had the hardest time getting it to work. I keep getting this message and I need more guideance on how to deploy it.
